## 🚀 What is it?

**DermaSkin Chatbot** is a non-diagnostic, non-medical AI assistant that gives you **lifestyle-based recommendations** to improve your skin health.

It’s built on the belief that **skincare starts with how you live**:  
your hydration, sleep, diet, stress levels, and environment — not just what you put on your face.

✅ No diagnosis  
✅ No medicines or prescriptions  
✅ Just simple, tailored lifestyle advice based on your inputs

## 💡 Why This Exists

Most skincare apps and bots overstep — offering medical suggestions or product recommendations without context.  
This chatbot takes a more **ethical**, **safe**, and **user-first approach**.

It listens to you.  
It asks the right questions.  
Then it gives you small, habit-based suggestions to improve your skin naturally.
